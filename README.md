# ToDo List
A short component based todo list that can add and take things away. Very limited functionality but could be added to an existing app easily. Components are for the form portion of the list and removing items from the list.

## RoadMap:
- Further styling is needed to make it look cleaner.
- remove item options could be made seperate from the items themselves
- historical list to show finished items or return return items that were removed by mistake
